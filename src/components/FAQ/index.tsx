    question: "Can Donna really book lessons automatically?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Donna chats with learners on WhatsApp, checks your availability, finds the best lesson slot, books it, and updates your portal automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Donna work with Google Calendar?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Your Google Calendar links straight to your portal, so the two always match. Donna works around what's already in your diary, respects your working hours, and adds confirmed lessons instantly — so you never miss a thing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a learner cancels?",
    answer:
      "Donna updates your calendar immediately and can help fill the newly available slot by handling new enquiries without any manual work.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customise lesson lengths and working hours?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Set your own lesson durations, breaks, working hours, holidays and preferred schedule. Donna follows your rules automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do learners need to install anything?",
    answer:
      "No. Everything happens through WhatsApp, so your learners already know how to use it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free trial?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every instructor gets a 30-day free trial — PDI, ADI or driving school — with no credit card required.",
